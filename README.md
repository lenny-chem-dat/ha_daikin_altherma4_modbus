# Daikin Altherma 4 Modbus Integration for Home Assistant

**⚠️ WARNING: Use at your own risk! This integration modifies heat pump settings. Incorrect configuration may damage your equipment or void warranty. Always consult the official Daikin documentation before making changes.**

**Note: Not all registers may provide valid values depending on your heat pump model and configuration. Some registers might return zero, error codes, or unexpected values. Always verify values against your heat pump's display or official documentation.**


## Daikin Altherma 4 Modbus Activation

Before using this integration, you need to enable Modbus TCP communication on your Daikin Altherma 4 heat pump.

### Modbus TCP/IP for Daikin Altherma

**NOTICE**: If the unit receives commands from both Modbus and Cloud interfaces, it will execute the command that was received most recently.

#### Modbus Protocol
The following Modbus protocol can be used:
- Modbus TCP/IP

**Modbus TCP/IP Parameters:**
- **Network**: Ethernet (Wifi not supported)
- **Port**:
  - No encryption: 502
  - TLS encryption: 802 (not tested)
- **IP Address**: IP address of Daikin Altherma 4

**Change-based Algorithm**
The Modbus algorithm is change based. This means the unit is only updated if a change in configuration is detected. To prevent changes being lost due to communication outages, it is recommended to periodically refresh the state from client side.

**Connection Limits**
**INFORMATION**: A total of 3 concurrent connections is possible.
Examples:
- 3x using the 502 port
- 3x using the 802 port
- Combination of both, e.g. 1x 502 and 2x 802

- **No Data**: Check Modbus TCP settings on your heat pump
- **Update Errors**: Ensure scan interval is appropriate (minimum 10 seconds)
- **Translation Issues**: Ensure proper language settings in Home Assistant
- **3-Way Valve Not Available**: Verify select entity configuration

### Connection & Network Issues
- **Device Offline**: Integration automatically retries connections and gracefully handles offline devices
- **Network Interruption**: Automatic reconnection with exponential backoff (max 30 seconds delay)
- **Timeout Errors**: Retry logic with 2-3 attempts before reporting failure
- **Multiple Connections**: Daikin supports max 3 concurrent Modbus connections

### Error Recovery Behavior
- **Connection Loss**: Integration attempts automatic reconnection without user intervention
- **Temporary Failures**: Short-term network issues are handled transparently
- **Persistent Failures**: After multiple failed attempts, entities show unavailable state
- **Log Management**: Errors are logged at appropriate levels without spamming logs

### Performance Issues
- **High Scan Frequency**: Reduce scan intervals if experiencing performance issues
- **Network Latency**: Use wired Ethernet connection for best performance
- **Register Access**: Some registers may be unsupported depending on heat pump model
- **Connection Pooling**: Integration uses optimized connection pooling for better performance
- **Batch Operations**: Register reads are batched for optimal Modbus efficiency

### Debug Mode
Enable debug logging in your `configuration.yaml`:

```yaml
logger:
  default: info
  logs:
    custom_components.ha_daikin_altherma4_modbus: debug
```

### Advanced Troubleshooting
- **Modbus Register Validation**: Use demo mode (host: localhost) to test integration logic
- **Network Testing**: Verify connectivity with `telnet <heat-pump-ip> 502`
- **Register Coverage**: Check device documentation for supported register ranges
- **Performance Monitoring**: Monitor Home Assistant logs for connection patterns

### Testing Without Hardware
Use the built-in mock client for development and testing:
- Set host to "localhost" in configuration
- Integration will use realistic mock data
- All 112 input registers generate realistic values
- Perfect for development and demonstration

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Please feel free to submit pull requests or open issues for bugs and feature requests.

### Development Setup
- Install test requirements: `pip install -r requirements-test.txt`
- Run tests: `make test-unit` or `python -m pytest tests/ --cov=custom_components/ha_daikin_altherma4_modbus`
- Use mock client for development without hardware
- Run full CI pipeline locally: `make ci-local`
- Code quality checks: `make lint` and `make format-check`
- Performance benchmarks: `make benchmark`

### Testing
The project includes a comprehensive test suite with 133 tests:
